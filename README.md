# LoRaWAN Blockchain Project
This project will allow a main antenna to communicate with receivers placed on animals in order to trace them all over the world. The communication is done using the LoRaWAN protocol.

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You will need to install the software by cloning the repository (master branch)
```
git clone https://gitlab.epai-ict.ch/m526/lorawan-blockchain.git
```

## How it works
Here is a diagram showing how the project works :
